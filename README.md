This program is a website for Pinnochio's Pizza in Harvard Square (http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/menu.html). I utilized the Django framework to create a method for users to browse the menu and order items with different sizes, toppings, and extras. Pinnochio's admin can add new items and change prices through the Django admin interface. Staff can also access the staff portal to view open and complete orders. I utilized slugs in urls for search engine optimization.
